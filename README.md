# Multi-Module Hexagonal Architecture Template

This repository serves as a template for building applications following a multi-module hexagonal architecture. The
architecture promotes modularity, separation of concerns, and testability, providing a solid foundation for developing
scalable and maintainable software systems.

## Introduction

This template provides a structured approach to building software systems based on the principles of hexagonal
architecture. By separating concerns into distinct modules, developers can easily understand, extend, and maintain the
codebase. The architecture facilitates testing and allows for seamless integration of new features.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: The template consists of multiple modules, each representing a distinct layer of the application (
  e.g., domain, application, infrastructure).
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Each module encapsulates its dependencies and exposes ports for interaction, promoting
  loose coupling and flexibility.
- **Scalability**: The modular design allows for the easy addition or removal of features without impacting other parts
  of the system.
- **Testability**: With clear boundaries between modules, writing unit tests and integration tests becomes
  straightforward, ensuring the reliability of the system.

## Technologies

The template utilizes modern technologies and frameworks commonly used in software development, including but not
limited to:

- **Programming Languages**: Java
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: TBD
- **Testing**: TBD

## Modules

The template consists of the following modules:

- **Domain**: Contains the core business logic and entities of the application.
- **Application**: Implements the application-specific use cases and orchestrates interactions between the domain and
  infrastructure layers.
- **Infrastructure**: Handles external concerns such as database access, HTTP clients, and external services.

## Usage

After cloning the repository and setting up the environment, you can start building your application based on the
template. Here are some recommended steps:

1. Define your domain entities and business logic in the `domain` module.
2. Implement application-specific use cases and services in the `application` module.
3. Configure infrastructure components such as databases and external APIs in the `infrastructure` module.
4. Write tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of your codebase.
5. Continuously iterate and improve your application, following the principles of hexagonal architecture.
